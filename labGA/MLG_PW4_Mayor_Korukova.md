## 6.1. Briefly explain the problem and your solution
*Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?*  



## 6.2 Provide the better route you found and the shortest path in kilometers. Is it the optimal shortest path ? explain.

## 6.3 Describe your fitness function

## 6.4 Explain the way you encoded the solution, give a chromosome example.

## 6.5 Provide the configuration of the GA you finally used to find your better results: mutation, crossover, population size, type of selection, mutation, crossover used, number of generations. Describe the methodology or experiments performed in order to get your better results.

## 6.6 Provide relevant plots of your experiments and explanations.

## 6.7 Conclusions
